# Image Processing

## Description
This README provides an overview of the tasks and instructions related to image processing, particularly focusing on building an image recognition classifier for house numbers.

## Tasks Covered
1. **Image Data Loading and Processing:**
   - Load the Housenumbers dataset with 531,131 images of house numbers cropped to 32x32 pixels in RGB format.
   - Convert images into a 4D matrix for processing.

2. **Feature Processing:**
   - Flatten the images to create a feature vector for machine learning.
   - Utilize the scikit-learn library to access and preprocess the dataset.
   
3. **Model Training:**
   - Implement a Random Forest classifier for training on the processed dataset.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train the model on the training set.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Test the trained model on new data to predict house numbers.
   - Evaluate the model accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Provide insights into classes where the model struggles the most.

5. **Additional Instructions for MNIST Dataset:**
   - Explore the MNIST database for hand-written digits.
   - Create a Random Forest model using the MNIST dataset.
   - Conduct parameter tuning and testing for model optimization.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the necessary dataset files.
2. Install Python and required libraries such as scikit-learn, numpy, and matplotlib.
3. Run the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for image processing tasks.
4. Follow the detailed steps outlined in the tasks to load, process, train, and evaluate the image recognition model.
