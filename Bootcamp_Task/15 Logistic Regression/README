# Supervised Learning with Logistic Regression

This repository contains materials focusing on supervised learning with logistic regression, covering classification problems, methodology, evaluation metrics, and practical tasks using the Iris dataset.

#### Content Overview
1. **Introduction to Logistic Regression**
   - Understanding logistic regression for binary classification tasks.
   - The sigmoid function and probability mapping.

2. **Logistic Regression Methodology**
   - Comparison to linear regression.
   - Formula for calculating probabilities for categories.
  
3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Utilizing confusion matrices to assess model predictions.
   - Calculation and interpretation of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. **Practical Task - Iris Dataset**
   - Implementation of logistic regression for predicting Iris species ('Iris-setosa' vs. others).
   - Data preprocessing, encoding categorical variables, model fitting, and evaluation.
