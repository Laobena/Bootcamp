# Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3 - README

This repository contains solutions for Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3, which involve Python programming. Each task has specific steps to follow for completion. Below are the details for each task:

## Task 1

Follow these steps for Task 1:

1. Create a new Python file in this folder called `award.py`.
2. Design a program that determines the award a person competing in a triathlon will receive.
3. Your program should read in the times (in minutes) for all three events of a triathlon, namely swimming, cycling, and running, and then calculate and display the total time taken to complete the triathlon.
4. The award a participant receives is based on the total time taken to complete the triathlon.
5. Display the award that the participant will receive based on the following criteria:
   - Qualifying Criteria: Time Range: Award
     - 0 - 100 minutes: Provincial colours
     - 101 - 105 minutes: Provincial half colours
     - 106 - 110 minutes: Provincial scroll
     - 111+ minutes: No award

## Task 2

Follow these steps for Task 2:

1. Create a new Python file in this folder called `numbers.py`.
2. Ask the user to enter three different integers.
3. Print the following outputs based on the user's input:
   - The sum of all the numbers.
   - The result of the first number minus the second number.
   - The product of the third number multiplied by the first number.
   - The sum of all three numbers divided by the third number.

## Task 3

Follow these steps for Task 3:

1. Create a new Python file in this folder called `manipulation.py`.
2. Design a program that prompts the user to enter a sentence using the `input()` function and save the user's response in a variable called `str_manip`.
3. Write code to:
   - Calculate and display the length of `str_manip`.
   - Find the last letter in `str_manip`, replace every occurrence of this letter with '@'.
   - Print the last three characters in `str_manip` backwards.
   - Create a five-letter word made up of the first three characters and the last two characters in `str_manip`.
