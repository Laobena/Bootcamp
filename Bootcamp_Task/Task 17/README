#### Task Descriptions

1. **Introduction**:
    - Provides an overview of machine learning concepts with a focus on regression analysis.
  
2. **Simple Linear Regression**:
    - Explains the fundamental principles and application of simple linear regression in estimating relationships between variables.

3. **Multiple Linear Regression**:
    - Explores modeling multiple variables simultaneously and the advantages over simple linear regression.

4. **Training and Testing Data**:
    - Discusses the importance of dividing data into training and testing sets and provides guidance on proper data distribution.

5. **Model Errors**:
    - Covers the assessment of error in regression models and the significance of test error over training error.

6. **Data Distribution in Training and Testing Sets**:
    - Details the necessity of balanced label distribution between training and testing sets for effective model evaluation.

#### Code Examples

- Includes practical code snippets using `scikit-learn` to implement regression models and split data for training and testing.
- Demonstrates fitting models, making predictions, and visualizing results for better understanding.
