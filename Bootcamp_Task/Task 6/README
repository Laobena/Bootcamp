## Practical Task: Calculating Total Holiday Cost

### Instructions
1. **File Creation**: Create a Python file named `holiday.py`.
2. **Input**: Gather user inputs for city of flight, number of nights staying at a hotel, and number of days for car rental.
3. **Functions**:
   - `hotel_cost(num_nights)`: Calculate the total cost for the hotel stay.
   - `plane_cost(city_flight)`: Determine the cost of the flight based on the selected city.
   - `car_rental(rental_days)`: Calculate the total cost of car rental.
   - `holiday_cost()`: Compute the total holiday cost using the above functions.
4. **Output**: Print out details about the holiday costs in a readable format.
5. **Experimentation**: Run the program with different input combinations to test its compatibility with different options.
