### Multiple Linear Regression in Supervised Learning

This repository contains materials related to understanding and implementing multiple linear regression in supervised learning, focusing on modeling the impact of multiple variables on an outcome simultaneously.

## Tasks Overview

1. **Introduction to Multiple Linear Regression**: Introduces the concept of multiple linear regression as an extension of simple linear regression to model the impact of multiple variables on the outcome simultaneously.

2. **Application of Multiple Linear Regression**: Discusses how to apply multiple linear regression using sklearn, featuring a practical example of predicting sales based on advertising data.

3. **Training and Test Data in Machine Learning**: Explains the significance of training and test datasets in machine learning, including dataset splitting, maintaining data distribution, and evaluating model performance.

4. **Handling Data Distribution in Training and Testing Sets**: Explores techniques to ensure a balanced distribution of labels in both training and testing datasets for accurate model evaluation.

5. **Training and Test Error in Regression**: Details the concept of training and test errors in regression models, emphasizing the importance of test error for model assessment.

6. **Measuring Error and Model Evaluation**: Describes different ways to measure error in regression models, such as Root Mean Squared Error and R-squared for model evaluation.

7. **Jupyter Notebook Practical Tasks**: Provides practical tasks in a Jupyter Notebook, including dataset loading, model training, prediction generation, and evaluating model performance using R-squared.

8. **Implementation Task**: Outlines steps to create a Jupyter Notebook named `diabetes_regression.ipynb` for predicting a person's condition progression using multiple linear regression.
