## Description
This README provides an overview of tasks related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) using SpaCy. The tasks cover various aspects of NLP, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and practical implementations.

## Tasks Overview
1. **Sentiment Analysis Model Implementation**
    - Load the en_core_web_sm SpaCy model for NLP tasks.
    - Preprocess text data by removing stopwords and cleaning text.
    - Design a function for sentiment analysis.
    - Test the sentiment analysis on sample product reviews.

2. **Working with Vectors**
    - Compare similarities between words using tokenization.
    - Detect similarities and differences using SpaCy's features.
    - Use advanced language models for improved similarity assessments.

3. **Question Answering Systems**
    - Understand NLP question-answering systems.
    - Test models on sample questions using SpaCy library capabilities.

4. **Practical Task: Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews**
    - Utilize SpaCy for sentiment analysis on a dataset of product reviews.
    - Preprocess text by removing stopwords and cleaning data.
    - Design and implement a sentiment analysis function.
    - Evaluate results and summarize findings in a report.

## Instructions
- Ensure SpaCy library and necessary language models are installed.
- Follow pre-processing guidelines for data cleaning and analysis.
- Test and evaluate sentiment analysis models on sample reviews.
- Generate a detailed report summarising the dataset, preprocessing steps, and model evaluations.
