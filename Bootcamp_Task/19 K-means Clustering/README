# Unsupervised Learning - K-means Clustering Task

## Description
This repository houses materials pertaining to the Unsupervised Learning task focusing on K-means Clustering. Participants will delve into the realm of unsupervised learning, specifically exploring the K-means clustering algorithm and its application in data analysis.

## Contents
- **Kmeans.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook featuring practical tasks related to the `Country-data.csv` dataset.

## Task Overview
Participants will engage in various tasks:
1. Load and preprocess the `Country-data.csv` dataset.
2. Explore different scatter plots to identify potential variable combinations for clustering.
3. Normalize the dataset using MinMaxScaler from scikit-learn.
4. Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and silhouette scores for evaluation.
5. Fit the scaled dataset to the optimal number of clusters and analyze the silhouette score.
6. Visualize clusters based on different variables such as Child mortality vs. GDPP and Inflation vs. GDPP.
7. Label country groups based on the identified clusters, providing reasoned justifications.

## Additional Resources
- The provided PDF material offers in-depth insights into unsupervised learning and practical guidance on implementing K-means clustering.
- Participants can utilise the resources within this repository to enhance their understanding of unsupervised learning concepts.
